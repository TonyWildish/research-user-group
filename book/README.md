# Cloud Native Research Workloads Book

This is the placeholder for the Cloud Native Research Workloads Book. See
[issue 16] for details.

## Overview

_One of the key areas identified by the CNCF Research User Group (RUG) for
improvement has been in the realm of documentation and best practices for
running Research Workloads in a "Cloud Native" way; or - on top of Kubernetes._

_Taking inspiration from the [Scientific OpenStack Community], RUG has decided to
do something similar and put together a book of user stories and best practices._

## Getting started with contributing

1. Respond to one of the [open topic issues] and self assign the topic.
2. Create directory associated with topic in this directory.
3. Add notes (markdown or LaTeX preferred) for the topic. They do **not** have
   ready to publish or anywhere near a final state.


When there is enough collective information it will be collated and formatted
with the aid of a tech writer into its book form.
